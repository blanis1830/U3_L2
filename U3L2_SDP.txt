Set up your main function so that you are solving 1000! with all three functions. What do you observe about the recursive_factorial() function?
For factorial and while factorial handle it well, but recursive_factorial gives a recursion error
In your own words, explain why recursion is a bad choice for large problems. Use your observations from this lab to support your conclusions.
The depth of recursion continues to grow and stack with input size. It overloads with a massive amount of information and causes recursion error.
